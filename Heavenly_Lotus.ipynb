That means the most used word appears twice as often as the second, three times as often as the third, and so on. This principle holds true in literature, social media, and even song lyrics."

are no lies you can thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas i'm on the brink of influential i'm here for you niggas i guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas i must have been hard to watch what a year for you niggas it's december st and we in miami just meditating you got your resolutions we just got reservations living out a dream it feels like i stayed up and we just want to party patron straight up fuck that old shit i'm on new things ovo clique red wing boot gang yeah we want it all half was never the agreement who would have thought the route we'd chosen would ever end up this scenic i can relate to kids going straight to the league when they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed and that's around the time that your idols become your rivals you make friends with mike but got to ai him for your survival damn i swear sports and music are so synonymous cause we want to be them and they want to be us so on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment that you take for granted yyou can thank me now and oh my goodness you're welcome you're welcome at this point me is who i am trying to save myself from rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them cause they think that i can help them get back to where they fell from but drink up cause everyone here is good tonight except the niggas that i came with they good for life that's how you know it's going down in case another chance never comes around   yyou could thank me now thank me now go 'head thank me later yeah i know what i said but later doesn't always come so instead it's okay you could thank me now you you you   uh shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming i think i'm spending all my time with the wrong women i think i'll have a chance at love and knowing me i'll miss it cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic man the good girls went silent on me they got a boyfriend or left for college on me and all the bad ones i used to hit are friends now that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me but do i ever come up in discussion over double pump lattes and low fat muffins do i or is missing what we had out of the question i'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson i got flows for the marilyn monroes who was there before it all i guess that's how it goes they hear about your cons but focus on your pros and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul but those same ones from your area will grow into women that are ready to get married at hello because of what they allowed where are they all now i know they're somewhere watching so i'm trying to make them proud searching for the meaning you'll find it next to me they tell me i'm the hottest guess we finally get to see i'm feeling like nas who am i to disagree they say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key that's probably why i'm in this bitch shining jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded and the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it i'm sorry poolside drinking margarita rounds shout out to my city though i hardly be in town i'm the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down i'm in a world where things are taken never given how long they choose to love you will never be your decision and i'm aware that this could be the last time you listen so while i'm still here in this position   yyou could thank me now thank me now go 'head go 'head thank me later yeah i know what i said what i said but later doesn't always come so instead it's okay you could thank me now it's a okay okay drake why do i feel so alone like everybody passing through the studio is in character as if

it as if i need that i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that my privacy about the only thing i need back but it's hard to think of them polite flows when stefano pilati suits are your night clothes and jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes and you still make it even when they say your flight closed eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows life was so full now this shit just

fortune teller listen to what i say 'member when we used to park up in my driveway i always told it how it was i never shy away this life is really something you get lost in i know niggas that got famous and they bought friends i had friends that only had half of they heart in it's hard to accept now and it was hard then but i treated you like gold i was all in spoiled rotten they could smell you 'fore you walked in burnin' incense in your new apartment but you got no sense when it come to lost you to the game i gotta hold that how you feelin' in your soul since you sold that i'll be better off without you and we know that you ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back like i'm tryna show the waves this is no cap you sold me up the river but i rowed back you put me on the road

being real is out of fashion niggas keep stealin' my style now we out here matchin' i did it by being myself with no dramatic acting i couldn't sit around and wait i had to have it happen lost you to the game i gotta face that really think i lost you like a ways back always sayin' how a nigga never play fair i took you up under my wing and you just stayed there you was supposed to grow some wings get your own pair we started this from the bottom now you alone there shit you treat it like it's home there dependent on me you was supposed to get your own share i still love you to my last days i never knew that shit would be this fastpaced i never thought i'd see awards in a glass case i could've ended up in your crib with a masked face it could've went left on a couple bad days when i visit my last place is the only time i'm in last place see me these days i never got on a sad face see me these days i lost you to the game and i see why it was always you and i without the ty this is not one of them stories that got three sides this is not one of them stories you could rewind like i'm tryna show the waves this is no cap you drove a nigga crazy but i drove back you wrote me off and then you never wrote back i'm not tryna make no song these are cold facts   drake  dennis graham yes sir baby hold on hold on let me tell you something about me i really do know i know who i wanna be woo lord i already passed on all that woo you go 'head on haha this is why i do this shit i think they call this venting   look this is me still the same they want the hits i play the game no autotune but you can feel the pain it all comes spilling out like i hit a vein what up lil bro what up slum ville i hope you know that y'all the reason i have fun still the fans thinking that we all signed for one mil equal opportunity rapping that shit is unreal that ain't how it works that ain't how it goes and i been getting high just to balance out the lows and i could use a writer just to balance out my flows but i never share my thoughts this is all a nigga knows and every time i try it opens up my eyes these verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised and i would be performing this as long as i'm alive so every word i utter will be mine   don't believe the lies look me in my eyes please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me i remember you this feeling isn't new so please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me   don't take this the wrong way but uh i never cried when pac died but i probably will when hov does and if my tears hold value then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us and i'll be standing in a puddle i stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble and i'ma keep it honest i'm so tired of being subtle it's just me 40 o and nik standing in a huddle staring at the members of my team who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams i hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems but y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion you know i spend money because spending time is hopeless and know i pop bottles 'cause i bottle my emotions at least i put it all in the open   don't believe the lies look me in my eyes please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me i remember you this feeling isn't new so please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me   look fuck all y'all we ignore feelings here premature millionaires welcome to my realest year yeah i swear that we making a killing here i should be on top of the world just chilling here but it's funny having fans who find you before anybody ever has the chance and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game and realize when you're there sometimes the shit don't feel the same yeah and plus things are just surreal at home people think i've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown and now security follow me everywhere so i never actually am alone i just always feel alone i think i'm scared of what the future holds i was wishing for some things and now am used to those every girl i meet thinks i'm fucking groupie hoes the honesty of my music has left me too exposed all my old friends think i got a new crowd and people seem to notice every time i do smile i guess that mean they come few and far between even though i'm living out what you would call the dream and my uncle ain't even messaging me and him missing in my life is kind of messing with me i hope this isn't one of those forever things it's funny how money can change everything   don't believe the lies look me in my eyes please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me i remember you this feeling isn't new so please don't be scared of me please don't be

talking yeah this dedicated to canada man the whole up north a lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter but listen   drake i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now it's december i'm driving and she's like where's my hi it's weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin' and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties  drake talking yeah man it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls y'know wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow   drake forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since i'm driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesn't answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat she's bold but i roll with it i'm impressed cause she's sweet then she says i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but i'm obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the  is good there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this i'm kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and it's kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached i'm thinkin off i should've been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho  drake talking yeah uh i told ya'll i had a story for you right uh ya man it's what it is   drake and now i'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say i'm actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone i'mma hold here down tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and it's dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and it's a shame she had me convinced that she could've been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime   drake talking i miss you most of all my darling beat fades out give me a second to gather my thoughts fades back in strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spring such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on 'em right strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing i'm still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby  4 drake i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drake's committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and we'd assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin' we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different it's a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin' crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin' i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin' the face the breast the bras the toes i'm still  and a long night draws to a close cause it's a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside we'll never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified it's what i'm lookin for to carry me through yet i can't seem to find it every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least there's some room to ride there's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive  voice strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and

know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date claim we early and be showing up extra late love but you don't really know me like you think you know me   drake they don't be saying how i'm humble i'm hella nice or that i've been approached to sign to rocafella twice they just tell you all the rumors they heard and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like amel and bryce my groove theory is that when you too cheery they try to bring you down to the level they at well when they are all unhappy then it gets a little sticky that's why i am little nicky to these devils in rap but uh they ain't thinking drake get smart girl nah they probably think i'll break your heart girl haha i can't lie you probably right about it and if you give me the ass quick i'll probably write about it but i hate it when they judge me on how i sound i mean i spit that influential shit from my town i don't know why you sitting on the couch when you see i got a bed bring your ass here and lie down you think taking your purse off will lead to me you taking shirts off and then your skirt off at least i got status because i could've been a local emcee and you probably would've been worse off so i'ma take this hat off and i'ma hit it till i'm back soft and then i backs off 'cause you thinking you can predict what happen you the reason i'm thinking i'm getting sick of rapping   drake ugh we know what you're thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you don't really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date claim we early and be showing up extra late love but you don't really know me like you think you know me   phonte you probably think i walk around with my gun tucked and swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks well you can think what you want but i think you've been watching too much bet uncut you need to get real and check out my real life i ain't a tipdrill don't care what it smell like but if you feel like putting all your notions aside and talking to a real nigga i'd gladly oblige first name phonte i'd be pleased to date ya college educated got degrees in papers but i'm from the south where if you ain't snapping or rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature such an anomaly speak so well and talk so collegy such an astonishing contrast to all the bullshit you've been following on behalf of them i offer my apologies maybe with me you'll unlearn putting all niggas in a box of concerns me 'cause i ain't dumb shit i'm wellread like sunburn and after me you'll never leave no stone unturned   drake ugh we know what you're thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you don't really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date claim we early and be showing up extra late love but you don't really know me like you think you know me   elzhi yeah they say you never judge a book by its cover though you appear as materialistic just like the others so i followed your words to take 'em in and i don't see what you saying so they coming off paperthin that's when i felt that i would need to do more than just look you up and down to see if i could read you and try to get inside your head only not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me so what i learned on my path to discover your story took one ugly turn after another i saw we wasn't on the same page i would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way so now i'm closing the case you only out for the paperback that's written all over your face no el will never judge a book by its cover until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under   drake ugh we know what you're thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips

picture you niggas go 'head frame it since we getting seinfeld on some jerry and elaine shit i flow far from mediocre and if we talking cards i will fold him with the poker you and your whole crew are

i'ma try and have you on the trip with me sliding through henri bendel like it's slippery and your exman is a hater officially probably 'cause he know i'm exactly what you wish he be yeah that's the reason why he looking hard 'cause i done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar he just mad 'cause his girl's at the house with her tongue sticking out like a michael jordan rookie card let me address this pardon me while i fix a couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix i guess he thought he could've been gotti in the flicks but at this point i'm just poking a body with a stick nowadays rapping is a children's hobby and girls keep telling me i'm still this snobby i tell them myself is who i am feeling probably just because i got a buzz like a building lobby it ain't a song that your ass finna skip i tried to sell weed give me cash for the zip the way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip millionaire shades fade with the waves

them boys that you came to see so get busy ya'll yep we take it to the same degree so let loose since you came with me get busy ya'll vo drake we them boys came to see get busy ya'll yeah we take it to the same degree so let loose cause you came get busy ya'llake we them boys that you came to see so get busy ya'll yep we take it to the same degree so let loose since you came with me get busy ya'll vo drake we them boys came to see get busy ya'll yeah we take it to the same degree so let loose cause you came get busy ya'll the first time the first time i met robyn fenty was 005 she was shooting a music video at a restaurant called avacado in toronto the song was pon de replay and the director and the director of the video was little x i was duced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner it's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called work  today the world knows little x as director x they know me as drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta but eleven years later they still know rihanna as the one and only rihanna  captivating from day one the iconic being that is rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going for them that's often the peak but for her that was a starting point as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since  when it comes to music she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release when it comes to performances they swarm in masses just to be in her presence obviously and when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself which is when it gets a little awkward  what's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats awards and accomplishments what's most impressive is the person some artists need to play a character to achieve success some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in she succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does which is being herself  this woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from barbados surrounded by the same friends speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at ovo fest we love the music which can change styles from album to album we love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year but most of all we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one  she's someone she's someone i've been in love with since i was  years old she's one of my she's one of my best friends in the world all my adult life i've looked up to her even though she's younger than me she's a living breathing legend in our industry ladies and gentlemen the recipient of the michael jackson vanguard award for 06 rihanna before we do this i just wanna say thanks man thank you for the years you spent working with some of toronto's true legends honing your craft thanks you for dropping everything to work with me after we met and realized we had something special thank you for pushing yourself despite the fact you should be resting to achieve an end goal that we are both

players rappers they tend to be smilin' because they swimmin' in women most of em seeking favors they come in secret flavors that's why i envy omar because so far i'm nowhere close to malik and deja and that's some higher learning trying to excel with the brake on i'll have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin' and i'm a liar turnin' 9 jaded with no faith in any female that's askin what i was earnin i met this recent lady she knew a piece of sadie by spinners i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby cause she ain't give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me it's like i'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy now i'm out of both and i've been thinkin' of alisha lately i'm all alone i got a feelin it's on cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh  hook voyce love's lost love's gone love lost love is gone   drake some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces circling workplaces and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is they get to first bases then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin' he wanna know what the first trace is now you like macgyver cause you sneakin' around and she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her i can relate to that i had to take it back a couple of years when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact i bet that they knew it cause in my mind i play through it with and in the end i listen but i don't see me as they do cause it's my opinion my life my potentials for my wife and i used to be eager to buy em the world maybe i'm confused about what i desire from girls either way i'm all alone got a feelin' it's on cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh  hook voyce love's lost love's gone love lost love is gone   drake check and nowadays some girls are the type of person that will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing since i ain't made them a purchase yet but there's logic behind it emotions double and they try to cover up like a mansion with the projects behind it i tend to freak with this i get a girl and pretend that i love the spending and all she gave was a decent kiss thinking she been spoiled but golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days and come up with tin foil we could dissect it see you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing gave her nothing ger reputation's in jeopardy cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me collectively i look for a proper chick that'll rep for me instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me for thinking that exists i got a feeling i'm wrong nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh  hook voyce love's lost love's gone love lost love is gone lupe fiasco uh what up y'all yeah soundtrakk what's popping baby if y'all ain't know i go by the name

an escape route they used to escape out when things got crazy they needed to break out they'd head to any place with stairs any good grinds the world was theirs and their four wheels would take them

freestyle shit i got a session with digs so the beef i'm gone end that anybody else get the piece that i bend back let it marinate if you niggas dare to hate drake sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough to feel what i'm about to say in this song when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself and you do it and get the feeling it's wrong that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping and they try to make you out as a lie it's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason it's a lose lose why even try when your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected and they never really know how to feel phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics and the motives to try and make them a mill you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and they just wanna say that you ain't around i mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town   x4 you gonna try to try harder cuz try harder cuz try trytrytry   drake and the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher than most of these rappers running the game certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash there's time i would have done it the same i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers because i'm really tend to need what i spent in a house that i promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time i wasted out late at the

from snippet     talkin' and a lil chitchat you rollin' with me then we fucking when we get back that's a  tell me if you with that don't decline just recline sit back  straight with today being the 5th anniversary of so far gone i figured it's fitting to return to it's place of its origin in order to clear the air about an extremely emotional day i completely support and agree with rolling stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary phillip seymour hoffman he is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication my frustration stemmed from the way it was executed the circumstances at hand are completely justifiable on the magazines behalf but i was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating they ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not i would have waited until it was my time because i understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but i just wasn't given that option and that made me feel violated i apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would i ever want to offend the hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment i am still the same person today i was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly these days are the worst ones waking up after a great night in the studio and it's your day to be picked apart after dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time so here i am having that moment i once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way i respect rolling stone for being willing to give a kid from toronto a shot at the cover i guess this is a day to learn and grow  sincerely  the boy yeah  i'm in new york and you're in long island i don't even treat you that good\\u2005girl\\u2005why you smilin' it's\\u2005three in the mornin' why are\\u2005you drivin' why you stoppin' for gas to get on the

sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like lebron to make that decision and that ultimate responsibility  drake  yeah i mean i think that for the last week and a half ive probably been bothering lebron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be i think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life hes in i dont think that theres a better way to deal with it than how he just did i think if we can give out an award at the espys for incredible essay writing i would definitely love to present that to him because i think what he just did was patriotic in its own way was courageous and was just to me i think its going to be one of the most historic things of our generation  im just honored to know him and glad that ive gotten to no pun intended witness this moment for sure i think its an incredible thing  i actually woke up kind of late today so im just catching on its a great feeling for me i cant wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud i am because hes been a friend of mine for a long time  shell  obviously youve joined saturday night live and weve had justin timberlake host the show are you going to take a more musical approach to the espys than what weve seen in the past  drake  i think obviously one of the talents that im able to bring to the espys is music but im just going to get up there and i want to just prepare a great night for people i think we have prepared an incredible night for people i definitely want to incorporate music but im not there to put on a strictly musicbased show yeah we definitely have some incredible pretapes yeah i think its just going to be a great night overall im there to deliver a great hosting job  shell  what makes the perfect espys host weve seen some amazing people like justin timberlake and john hamm and even lebron james what strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer  drake  well i think what makes a perfect espys host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats but i think most importantly what i bring is the fact that i feel that i know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys i have personal relationships with i think im going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that i dont know  to me its just about knowing the room that youre in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve  shell  hosting a sports awards show what do you feel is musics role in sports  drake  well i said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go i think that when i speak to any of my friends that play sports theyre always super into music whether it be rap or other genres my dream in life or my other dream in life that ill obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league so i think theyre synonymous in that way we inspire each other and i think thats what really ties music and sports together  shell  this is a question for the producer and if possible i have a followup for drake with the lebron news and the decision that was so successful for espn was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the espys did anybody reach out were you close  maura mandt  no there was not an attempt to have that be there and with the decision it wasnt something we were looking to have that announcement be on the espys certainly if lebron wanted to announce on the espys i would have happily had him there i think what the espys is about is the sports world plays out over the year and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective and thats what you look for the host for  were going to be reflecting on the year and lebron is something that happened so it will definitely be something that well address in the show but just like in sports we dont try to make that news happen it unfolds  shell  drake in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance and a lot of times in hiphop thats kind of also a part of rap music and its always been do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage whether it be metaphorically or outright in hiphop  drake  i think thats a funny question i think its a good fit i definitely think that hiphop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for i think were not trying to end peoples careers or make people feel bad in any way and thats kind of most of the time what problems in hiphop are about so our night like i said is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports  so yeah i think there is definitely a difference though being clever with words is being clever with words so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has but i think the end goals are a bit different  shell  youre also being aware of public perception for instance you instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer right and you so like you definitely have i dont know how to put it maybe a love triangle thing going on with skylar and shell probably be there can we expect a joke or where youll mention it like you did with snl when you did the whole dated rihanna thing everyone loved it so can we expect that now that youll be hosting the espys  drake  well i obviously dont want to give away the material but i do have a growing affection for skylar and im not sure shell be able to make it but im sure ill give you a treat if you enjoy my past references im sure if i havent done it already now that i know youre looking for it i might stick one in there for sure you never know  shell  one of the things about espn and the espys is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the buildup  today i dont know if you realize this but youve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that chris brown posted up i just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means  drake  well as far as the latter end of the question id rather not comment on it but i know that our goal is obviously the night of the espys to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards i think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet thats why im excited  weve been working hard like i said on the pretapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night which i can 00 guarantee it will  shell  is cleveland your new favorite sports city how are you going to incorporate a wiggins manziel and lb james into your espy segment  drake  first of all id like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks i do not team jump ive been  in the past ive always supported the player and not the institution unless its the kentucky wildcats or the toronto raptors those are two teams that i will never stray from but what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer whether it comes to football or obviously basketball i have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams  so its not that im team jumping im just a supportive friend with the recent news of course im going to go  of course im going to go watch games in cleveland if not for lebron who like i said has been a brother to me for years i mean weve got three kids from toronto on one team plus we have manziel who again is part of our family and like a brother  so i definitely have to look into some real estate in cleveland and maybe make some trips this year i might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best  but yeah like i said my teams will always forever be who they are but yes i will support the group that has shifted to cleveland i think that for cleveland a place that ive been time and time again touring i just think its going to be greet i really would love to see that city grow because theyre just a supportive group of people and it is a great place so im really excited  shell  so the espys is your second host gig this year snl was amazing by the way so is hosting something that youre trying to do more of or are you just working on more music you have a lot to write about now that youre a bachelor again  drake  well actually my status hasnt changed just to clear that up ive always been out here coasting but aside from that the espys is my main focus like snl when i commit to something i dont let my focus stray  so for maura to give me this opportunity to host i dont take it lightly i put everything on hold to be  to give the best performance that i possibly can at this awards show and then from there i have things coming up whether its the ovo fest or the tour with lil wayne which is a real thing which a lot of people dont know if its a real thing or not but its very real and its going to be very competitive and then from there ill figure out the next steps for me  im always working on new music but the espys is the main focus right now and well figure out whats next afterwards  shell  one thing we learned about you after hosting snl is youre a tremendous impressionist i personally loved the katt williams and lil wayne  with having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show   drake  yeah im actually excited to say that i definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance and that is something that i actually pride in that i studied for i love finding a character and getting into that character especially if i know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms so yes i will be doing impressions during the espys and theyre good im excited  theyre great  shell  are you bringing your lint roller  drake  oh yes i think ill probably have it somewhere around maybe i should i should bring it out on stage you shouldnt have said it on the call you should have anonymously sent that tip in maybe we would have used the joke no i think ill be lintfree that night ill have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit  shell  so we know that you wore some custom calvin klein outfits for your tour are you planning on the same fashion wearing any calvin klein suits and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what theyre going to wear  drake  im not exactly sure what brands im going to be wearing right now im sort of still like i said very focused on the show ill figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers ill be wearing but im more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that ill be draped in for you all to admire so thats really what my main focus is but ill get my suits together im also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself i might just cut to somebody and i wont have to say anything  shell  you have so many relationships with a lot of athletes is there anyone in particular that you havent met yet that youre looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that youre with already given you any advice about hosting  drake  well i mean ive gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends you know one of my mentors who is not an athlete but obviously jamie foxx a previous host and a big reason why i asked to be a part of this just because that performance that he gave i believe he hosted twice or three times oh twice right it was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was so his mentorship and advice has been great to me is there anybody that im looking forward to meeting i mean yeah i was going to say ive never met skylar im sure it will be extremely awkward when i do but i guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up which she probably wont her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something but yeah if i ever get to meet her i probably owe her an apology right off the bat its been all in good spirits but yeah that is the one person id like to meet  just for that last person i also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music i want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down yeah nick whatever his name is because he didnt win so thats how hes going to be remembered nick whatever his name is  shell  can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you and how many are coming from the writing staff also if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song  drake  oh very good double question well for the first part the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible we have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady maura all the way down to the writers and everybody thats involved everyone involved has been incredible to work with weve been at it now for three months i think just on and off meeting and talking and brain storming as far as ideas being mine i am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that i submitted are what im going to be performing or delivering on wednesday night whether it be music jokes and pretaped pieces i was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it  is writing a joke harder than writing a song i think that because of the way i write songs which is very honest raw emotion about my life i think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because its just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding drake song as the public would deem it  but yeah i mean all my music is so honest that sometimes its hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself when youre able to be lighthearted and joke around i enjoy it it comes a little quicker than songs do  mandt  id like to make a comment on the collaboration process having worked on the show a number of years one of the things that really resonates in the content is when its authentic from the person delivering it being able to have the access weve had to drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on whats coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life it really elevates it so its definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved  we had a shoot the other day from one of the skits and on set he was coming up with stuff and you guys will see it and know what im talking about when you see the show but there was no script in certain areas of it it was really like an improv session and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see im really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show drake  future if young metro don't trust you im gon' shoot you yeah ah yeah halloween taliban taliban i'm gon

to follow lately ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle alohas to women with no ties to men that i know well that way there are no lies you can thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas im on the brink of influential im here for you niggas i guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas i must have been hard to watch what a year for you niggas its december st and we in miami just meditating you got your resolutions we just got reservations living out a dream it feels like i stayed up and we just want to party patron straight up fuck that old shit im on new things ovo clique red wing boot gang yeah we want it all half was never the agreement who would have thought the route wed chosen would ever end up this scenic i can relate to kids going straight to the league when they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals you make friends with mike but got to ai him for your survival damn i swear sports and music are so synonymous cause we want to be them and they want to be us so on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment that you take for granted yyou can thank me now and oh my goodness youre welcome youre welcome at this point me is who i am trying to save myself from rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them cause they think that i can help them get back to where they fell from but drink up cause everyone here is good tonight except the niggas that i came with they good for life thats how you know its going down in case another chance never comes around   yyou could thank me now thank me now go head thank me later yeah i know what i said but later doesnt always come so instead its okay you could thank me now you you you   uh shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming i think im spending all my time with the wrong women i think ill have a chance at love and knowing me ill miss it cause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic man the good girls went silent on me they got a boyfriend or left for college on me and all the bad ones i used to hit are friends now that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me but do i ever come up in discussion over double pump lattes and low fat muffins do i or is missing what we had out of the question im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson i got flows for the marilyn monroes who was there before it all i guess thats how it goes they hear about your cons but focus on your pros and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul but those same ones from your area will grow into women that are ready to get married at hello because of what they allowed where are they all now i know theyre somewhere watching so im trying to make them proud searching for the meaning youll find it next to me they tell me im the hottest guess we finally get to see im feeling like nas who am i to disagree they say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key thats probably why im in this bitch shining jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it im sorry poolside drinking margarita rounds shout out to my city though i hardly be in town im the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down im in a world where things are taken never given how long they choose to love you will never be your decision and im aware that this could be the last time you listen so while im still here in this position   yyou could thank me now thank me now go head go head thank me later yeah i know what i said what i said but later doesnt always come so instead its okay you could thank me now its a okay okay drake why do i feel so alone like everybody passing through the studio is in character as if he acting out a movie role talking bullshit as if it was for you to know and i dont have the heart to give these bitch niggas the cue to go so they stick around kicking out feedback and i entertain it as if i need that i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that my privacy about the only thing i need back but its hard to think of them polite flows when stefano pilati suits are your night clothes and jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes and you still make it even when they say your flight closed eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows life was so full now this shit just being lipod always said id say it all on the right track but in this game you only lose when you fight back black diamond bracelets showing you the basics i cant live and hold the camera someone gotta tape this and make hits like a bitch thats married i aint miss  hours from greatness im that close dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt transitioning from fitting in to standing out los angeles cabanas or atlanta south watchin hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out and my mother embarrassed to pull my phantom out so i park about five houses down she say i shouldnt have it until i have the crown but i dont wanna feel the need to wear disguises around so she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus but yet im rolling round the fuckin city like your highness got niggas reactin without a sinus cause what im working with is timeless and promoters try to get me out to they club and say i have fun but i cant imagine how cause i just seen my exgirl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that im fuckin right now and shit could get weird unless they all down and so i stay clear we from a small town and everybody talks and everybody listen and somehow the truth just always comes up missing ive always been something that these labels cant buy especially if they tryin to take a piece of my soul and sylvia be tellin tez damn drake fly and he just be like silly motherfucker i know that was your bad how could you pass up on em he just take

feel the pain it all comes spilling out like i hit a vein what up lil bro what up slum ville i hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still the fans thinking that we all signed for one mil equal opportunity rapping that shit is unreal that aint how it works that aint how it goes and i been getting high just to balance out the lows and i could use a writer just to balance out my flows but i never share my thoughts this is all a nigga knows and every time i try it opens up my eyes these verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised and i would be performing this as long as im alive so every word i utter will be mine   dont believe the lies look me in my eyes please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me i remember you this feeling isnt new so please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me   dont take this the wrong way but uh i never cried when pac died but i probably will when hov does and if my tears hold value then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us and ill be standing in a puddle i stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble and ima keep it honest im so tired of being subtle its just me  o and nik standing in a huddle staring at the members of my team who get questioned bout they profit from this million dollar scheme just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams i hope you tell your families this shit aint what it seems but yall the reason for a lot of my devotion you know i spend money because spending time is hopeless and know i pop bottles cause i bottle my emotions at least i put it all in the open   dont believe the lies look me in my eyes please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me i remember you this feeling isnt new so please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me   look fuck all yall we ignore feelings here premature millionaires welcome to my realest year yeah i swear that we making a killing here i should be on top of the world just chilling here but its funny having fans who find you before anybody ever has the chance and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game and realize when youre there sometimes the shit dont feel the same yeah and plus things are just surreal at home people think ive changed just cause my appeal has grown and now security follow me everywhere so i never actually am alone i just always feel alone i think im scared of what the future holds i was wishing for some things and now am used to those every girl i meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes the honesty of my music has left me too exposed all my old friends think i got a new crowd and people seem to notice every time i do smile i guess that mean they come few and far between even though im living out what you would call the dream and my uncle aint even messaging me and him missing in my life is kind of messing with me i hope this isnt one of those forever things its funny how money can change everything   dont believe

this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now its december im driving and shes like wheres my hi its weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summers caught hoin the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties  drake talking yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls yknow wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow   drake forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since im driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the  is good theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this im kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin and now my heart attached im thinkin off i shouldve been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho  drake talking yeah uh i told yall i had a story for you right uh ya man its what it is   drake and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone imma hold here down tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and its dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime   drake talking i miss you most of all my darling beat fades out give me a second to gather my thoughts fades back in strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spring such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on em right strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing im still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby   drake i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drakes committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and wed assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different its a

em wrong though   drake ugh we know what youre thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you dont really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date claim we early and be showing up extra late love but you dont really know me like you think you know me   drake they dont be saying how im humble im hella nice or that ive been approached to sign to rocafella twice they just tell you all the rumors they heard and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like amel and bryce my groove theory is that when you too cheery they try to bring you down to the level they at well when they are all unhappy then it gets a little sticky thats why i am little nicky to these devils in rap but uh they aint thinking drake get smart girl nah they probably think ill break your heart girl haha i cant lie you probably right about it and if you give me the ass quick ill probably write about it but i hate it when they judge me on how i sound i mean i spit that influential shit from my town i dont know why you sitting on the couch when you see i got a bed bring your ass here and lie down you think taking your purse off will lead to me you taking shirts off and then your skirt off at least i got status because i couldve been a local emcee and you probably wouldve been worse off so ima take this hat off and ima hit it till im back soft and then i backs off cause you thinking you can predict what happen you the reason im thinking im getting sick of rapping   drake ugh we know what youre thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you dont really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date claim we early and be showing up extra late love but you dont really know me like you think you know me   phonte you probably think i walk around with my gun tucked and swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks well you can think what you want but i think youve been watching too much bet uncut you need to get real and check out my real life i aint a tipdrill dont care what it smell like but if you feel like putting all your notions aside and talking to a real nigga id gladly oblige first name phonte id be pleased to date ya college educated got degrees in papers but im from the south where if you aint snapping or rapping bout trapping yous a freak of nature such an anomaly speak so well and talk so collegy such an astonishing contrast to all the bullshit youve been following on behalf of them i offer my apologies maybe with me youll unlearn putting all niggas in a box of concerns me cause i aint dumb shit im wellread like sunburn and after me youll never leave no stone unturned   drake ugh we know what youre thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you dont really know me like you

coming off paperthin thats when i felt that i would need to do more than just look you up and down to see if i could read you and try to get inside your head only not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me so what i learned on my path to discover your story took one ugly turn after another i saw we wasnt on the same page i wouldve gave you strong play but your words

looked at what lies are under   drake ugh we know what youre thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you dont really know me like you think

them boys that you came to see so get busy yall yep we take it to the same degree so let loose since you came with me get busy yall vo drake we them boys came to see get busy yall yeah we take it to the same degree so let loose cause you came get busy yallake we them boys that you came to see so get busy yall yep we take it to the same degree so let loose since you came with me get busy yall vo drake we them boys came to see get busy yall yeah we take it to the same degree so let loose cause you came get busy yall the first time the first time i met robyn fenty was  she was shooting a music video at a restaurant called avacado in toronto the song was pon de replay and the director and the director of the video was little x i was duced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner its hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called work  today the world knows little x as director x they know me as drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta but eleven years later they still know rihanna as the one and only rihanna  captivating from day one the iconic being that is rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going for them thats often the peak but for her that was a starting point as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since  when it comes to music she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release when it comes to performances they swarm in masses just to be in her presence obviously and when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself which is when it gets a little awkward  whats most impressive isnt the endless list of stats awards and accomplishments whats most impressive is the person some artists need to play a character to achieve success some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in she succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does which is being herself  this woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from barbados surrounded by the same friends speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless its to come and perform at ovo fest we love the music which can change styles from album to album we love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year but most of all we love the woman who hasnt changed since day one  shes someone shes someone ive been in love with since i was  years old shes one of my shes one of my best friends in the world all my adult life ive looked up to her even though shes younger than me shes a living breathing legend in our industry ladies and gentlemen the recipient of the michael jackson vanguard award for  rihanna before we do this i just wanna say thanks man thank you for the years you spent working with some of torontos true legends honing your craft thanks you for dropping everything to work with me after we

gone love lost love is gone   drake look in this world of desperate housewives and freakin players rappers they tend to be smilin because they swimmin in women most of em seeking favors they come in secret flavors thats why i envy omar because so far im nowhere close to malik and deja and thats some higher learning trying to excel with the brake on ill have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin and im a liar turnin  jaded with no faith in any female thats askin what i was earnin i met this recent lady she knew a piece of sadie by spinners i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby cause she aint give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me its like im using some bread to sop up some decent gravy now im out of both and ive been thinkin of alisha lately im all alone i got a feelin its on cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh  hook voyce loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone   drake some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces circling workplaces and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is they get to first bases then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin he wanna know what the first trace is now you like macgyver cause you sneakin around and she dont know that you there when you standin right beside her i can relate to that i had to take it back a couple of years when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact i bet that they knew it cause in my mind i play through it with and in the end i listen but i dont see me as they do cause its my opinion my life my potentials for my wife and i used to be eager to buy em the world maybe im confused about what i desire from girls either way im all alone got a feelin its on cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh  hook voyce loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone   drake check and nowadays some girls are the type of person that will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing since i aint made them a purchase yet but theres logic behind it emotions double and they try to cover up like a mansion with the projects behind it i tend to freak with this i get a girl and pretend that i love the spending and all she gave was a decent kiss thinking she been spoiled but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days and come up with tin foil we could dissect it see you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing gave her nothing ger reputations in jeopardy cause it aint take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me collectively i look for a proper chick thatll rep for me instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me for thinking that exists i got a feeling im wrong nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh  hook voyce loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone lupe fiasco uh what up yall yeah soundtrakk whats

shit i got a session with digs so the beef im gone end that anybody else get the piece that i bend back let it marinate if you niggas dare to hate drake sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough to feel what im about to say in this song when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself and you do it and get the feeling its wrong that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping and they try to make you out as a lie its ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason its a lose lose why even try when your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected and they never really know how to feel phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics and the motives to try and make them a mill you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and they just wanna say that you aint around i mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town   x you gonna try to try harder cuz try harder cuz try trytrytry   drake and the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin is fresher than most of these rappers running the game certain people will copy whats in the past to turn the profit with cash theres time i would have done it the same i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers because im really tend to need what i spent in a house that i promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time i wasted out late at the club instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner im working hard on the winter so this album is a labor of love you say as long as im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats that she can rest without a toss

chitchat you rollin with me then we fucking when we get back thats a  tell me if you with that dont decline just recline sit back  straight with today being the th anniversary of so far gone i figured its fitting to return to its place of its origin in order to clear the air about an extremely emotional day i completely support and agree with rolling stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary phillip seymour hoffman he is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication my frustration stemmed from the way it was executed the circumstances at hand are completely justifiable on the magazines behalf but i was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating they ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not i would have waited until it was my time because i understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but i just wasnt given that option and that made me feel violated i apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would i ever want to offend the hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment i am still the same person today i was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly these days are the worst ones waking up after a great night in the studio and its your day to be picked apart after dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time so here i am having that moment i once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way i respect rolling stone for being willing to give a kid from toronto a shot at the cover i guess this is a day to learn and grow  sincerely  the boy yeah  im in new york and youre in long island i dont even treat you that good\\u2005girl\\u2005why you smilin its\\u2005three in the mornin why are\\u2005you drivin why you stoppin for gas to get on the highway just to end up in my place

i was an actor and i was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles being stereotyped and type cast the photos represented how african americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment me and my best friend at the time mazin elsadig who is also an actor from sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions this was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry and to make a point that the struggle for black actors

crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like lebron to make that decision and that ultimate responsibility  drake  yeah i mean i think that for the last week and a half ive probably been bothering lebron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be i think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life hes in i dont think that theres a better way to deal with it than how he just did i think if we can give out an award at the espys for incredible essay writing i would definitely love to present that to him because i think what he just did was patriotic in its own way was courageous and was just to me i think its going to be one of the most historic things of our generation  im just honored to know him and glad that ive gotten to no pun intended witness this moment for sure i think its an incredible thing  i actually woke up kind of late today so im just catching on its a great feeling for me i cant wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud i am because hes been a friend of mine for a long time  shell  obviously youve joined saturday night live and weve had justin timberlake host the show are you going to take a more musical approach to the espys than what weve seen in the past  drake  i think obviously one of the talents that im able to bring to the espys is music but im just going to get up there and i want to just prepare a great night for people i think we have prepared an incredible night for people i definitely want to incorporate music but im not there to put on a strictly musicbased show yeah we definitely have some incredible pretapes yeah i think its just going to be a great night overall im there to deliver a great hosting job  shell  what makes the perfect espys host weve seen some amazing people like justin timberlake and john hamm and even lebron james what strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer  drake  well i think what makes a perfect espys host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats but i think most importantly what i bring is the fact that i feel that i know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys i have personal relationships with i think im going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that i dont know  to me its just about knowing the room that youre in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve  shell  hosting a sports awards show what do you feel is musics role in sports  drake  well i said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go i think that when i speak to any of my friends that play sports theyre always super into music whether it be rap or other genres my dream in life or my other dream in life that ill obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league so i think theyre synonymous in that way we inspire each other and i think thats what really ties music and sports together  shell  this is a question for the producer and if possible i have a followup for drake with the lebron news and the decision that was so successful for espn was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the espys did anybody reach out were you close  maura mandt  no there was not an attempt to have that be there and with the decision it wasnt something we were looking to have that announcement be on the espys certainly if lebron wanted to announce on the espys i would have happily had him there i think what the espys is about is the sports world plays out over the year and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective and thats what you look for the host for  were going to be reflecting on the year and lebron is something that happened so it will definitely be something that well address in the show but just like in sports we dont try to make that news happen it unfolds  shell  drake in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance and a lot of times in hiphop thats kind of also a part of rap music and its always been do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage whether it be metaphorically or outright in hiphop  drake  i think thats a funny question i think its a good fit i definitely think that hiphop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for i think were not trying to end peoples careers or make people feel bad in any way and thats kind of most of the time what problems in hiphop are about so our night like i said is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports  so yeah i think there is definitely a difference though being clever with words is being clever with words so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has but i think the end goals are a bit different  shell  youre also being aware of public perception for instance you instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer right and you so like you definitely have i dont know how to put it maybe a love triangle thing going on with skylar and shell probably be there can we expect a joke or where youll mention it like you did with snl when you did the whole dated rihanna thing everyone loved it so can we expect that now that youll be hosting the espys  drake  well i obviously dont want to give away the material but i do have a growing affection for skylar and im not sure shell be able to make it but im sure ill give you a treat if you enjoy my past references im sure if i havent done it already now that i know youre looking for it i might stick one in there for sure you never know  shell  one of the things about espn and the espys is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the buildup  today i dont know if you realize this but youve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that chris brown posted up i just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means  drake  well as far as the latter end of the question id rather not comment on it but i know that our goal is obviously the night of the espys to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards i think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet thats why im excited  weve been working hard like i said on the pretapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night which i can  guarantee it will  shell  is cleveland your new favorite sports city how are you going to incorporate a wiggins manziel and lb james into your espy segment  drake  first of all id like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks i do not team jump ive been  in the past ive always supported the player and not the institution unless its the kentucky wildcats or the toronto raptors those are two teams that i will never stray from but what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer whether it comes to football or obviously basketball i have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams  so its not that im team jumping im just a supportive friend with the recent news of course im going to go  of course im going to go watch games in cleveland if not for lebron who like i said has been a brother to me for years i mean weve got three kids from toronto on one team plus we have manziel who again is part of our family and like a brother  so i definitely have to look into some real estate in cleveland and maybe make some trips this year i might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best  but yeah like i said my teams will always forever be who they are but yes i will support the group that has shifted to cleveland i think that for cleveland a place that ive been time and time again touring i just think its going to be greet i really would love to see that city grow because theyre just a supportive group of people and it is a great place so im really excited  shell  so the espys is your second host gig this year snl was amazing by the way so is hosting something that youre trying to do more of or are you just working on more music you have a lot to write about now that youre a bachelor again  drake  well actually my status hasnt changed just to clear that up ive always been out here coasting but aside from that the espys is my main focus like snl when i commit to something i dont let my focus stray  so for maura to give me this opportunity to host i dont take it lightly i put everything on hold to be  to give the best performance that i possibly can at this awards show and then from there i have things coming up whether its the ovo fest or the tour with lil wayne which is a real thing which a lot of people dont know if its a real thing or not but its very real and its going to be very competitive and then from there ill figure out the next steps for me  im always working on new music but the espys is the main focus right now and well figure out whats next afterwards  shell  one thing we learned about you after hosting snl is youre a tremendous impressionist i personally loved the katt williams and lil wayne  with having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show   drake  yeah im actually excited to say that i definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance and that is something that i actually pride in that i studied for i love finding a character and getting into that character especially if i know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms so yes i will be doing impressions during the espys and theyre good im excited  theyre great  shell  are you bringing your lint roller  drake  oh yes i think ill probably have it somewhere around maybe i should i should bring it out on stage you shouldnt have said it on the call you should have anonymously sent that tip in maybe we would have used the joke no i think ill be lintfree that night ill have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit  shell  so we know that you wore some custom calvin klein outfits for your tour are you planning on the same fashion wearing any calvin klein suits and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what theyre going to wear  drake  im not exactly sure what brands im going to be wearing right now im sort of still like i said very focused on the show ill figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers ill be wearing but im more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that ill be draped in for you all to admire so thats really what my main focus is but ill get my suits together im also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself i might just cut to somebody and i wont have to say anything  shell  you have so many relationships with a lot of athletes is there anyone in particular that you havent met yet that youre looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that youre with already given you any advice about hosting  drake  well i mean ive gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends you know one of my mentors who is not an athlete but obviously jamie foxx a previous host and a big reason why i asked to be a part of this just because that performance that he gave i believe he hosted twice or three times oh twice right it was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was so his mentorship and advice has been great to me is there anybody that im looking forward to meeting i mean yeah i was going to say ive never met skylar im sure it will be extremely awkward when i do but i guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up which she probably wont her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something but yeah if i ever get to meet her i probably owe her an apology right off the bat its been all in good spirits but yeah that is the one person id like to meet  just for that last person i also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music i want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down yeah nick whatever his name is because he didnt win so thats how hes going to be remembered nick whatever his name is  shell  can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you and how many are coming from the writing staff also if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song  drake  oh very good double question well for the first part the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible we have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady maura all the way down to the writers and everybody thats involved everyone involved has been incredible to work with weve been at it now for three months i think just on and off meeting and talking and brain storming as far as ideas being mine i am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that i submitted are what im going to be performing or delivering on wednesday night whether it be music jokes and pretaped pieces i was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it  is writing a joke harder than writing a song i think that because of the way i write songs which is very honest raw emotion about my life i think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because its just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding drake song as the public would deem it  but yeah i mean all my music is so honest that sometimes its hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself when youre able to be lighthearted and joke around i enjoy it it comes a little quicker than songs do  mandt  id like to make a comment on the collaboration process having worked on the show a number of years one of the things that really resonates in the content is when its authentic from the person delivering it being able to have the access weve had to drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on whats coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life it really elevates it so its definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved  we had a shoot the other day from one of the skits and on set he was coming up with stuff and you guys will see it and know what im talking about when you see the show but there was no script in certain areas of it it was really like an improv session and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see im really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show drake  future
