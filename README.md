# **🎶 Zipf's Law in Drake's Lyrics**
This project explores the presence of Zipf’s Law in the song lyrics of the artist Drake. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, we tokenize lyrics, analyze word frequencies, and visualize the statistical patterns of language in music.
# **📁 Dataset**
Source: [Lyrics Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dKSgBLRscYdDYZNSQ3juS9cAKpFMAlmc)
Content: Lyrics from various Drake songs
Cleaning: Punctuation removal, tokenization, and stop-word filtering
# **📊 Key Concepts**
Zipf’s Law: A pattern where word frequency is inversely proportional to its rank
Stop Word Removal: To better observe meaningful word distribution
Log-Log Plotting: Used to visualize rank-frequency relationships
Linear Regression: Estimate Zipfian exponent (should be near -1)
# **📌 Features**
Word frequency analysis
Zipf’s Law visualization (with and without stop words)
Top 20 frequent words before and after cleaning
Linear regression fit to log-log plot
# **🧪 Technologies Used**
