# **🎶 Zipf's Law in Drake's Lyrics**
This project explores the presence of Zipf’s Law in the song lyrics of the artist Drake. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, we tokenize lyrics, analyze word frequencies, and visualize the statistical patterns of language in music.<br>
# **📁 Dataset**
Source: [Lyrics Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dKSgBLRscYdDYZNSQ3juS9cAKpFMAlmc)<br>
Content: Lyrics from various Drake songs<br>
Cleaning: Punctuation removal, tokenization, and stop-word filtering<br>
# **📊 Key Concepts**
Zipf’s Law: A pattern where word frequency is inversely proportional to its rank<br>
Stop Word Removal: To better observe meaningful word distribution<br>
Log-Log Plotting: Used to visualize rank-frequency relationships<br>
Linear Regression: Estimate Zipfian exponent (should be near -1)<br>
# **📌 Features**
Word frequency analysis<br>
Zipf’s Law visualization (with and without stop words)<br>
Top 20 frequent words before and after cleaning<br>
Linear regression fit to log-log plot<br>
# **🧪 Technologies Used**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)<br>
Google Colab<br>
